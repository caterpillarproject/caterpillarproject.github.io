Here is the poster presented at University of Michigan Local Group Astrostatistics Conference: <a href="/assets/science/satelliteplanes/ji_poster.pdf">PDF</a>

A paper is in preparation, expected submission in late June. In the meantime, here are some additional plots that were of interest to people at the conference.

## Radial Profiles
Satellite position radial profiles compared to the 11 classical Milky Way satellites.
The colored lines correspond to different choices of satellites. Blue lines are the first 11 satellites by Vpeak, Green lines are satellites with stellar mass > 10^5.5 Msun, Red lines are satellites with stellar mass > 10^5 Msun. Stellar masses found by Moster et al. 2013 abundance matching.

## Orbital alignment with plane
Here we plot the cumulative number of satellites whose angular momentum is within a certain angle of the plane's minor axis. Solid lines indicate total number pointing in either direction (i.e. co-rotating and anti-co-rotating). Dashed lines indicate total number pointing in single direction.

## Edge-On and Face-On Satellite Distributions
Here are the spatial positions of the satellites relative to the best-fit plane. The colored dots are satellites with stellar mass > 10^5 Msun (the red lines in previous plots). Arrows indicate where the satellite will travel in 1Myr given its current velocity.
