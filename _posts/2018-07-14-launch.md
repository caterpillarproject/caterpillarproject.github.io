Welcome to the new and improved Caterpillar Project website. Today we launch both a new website and improved documentation for the project. 

The data itself follows three release phases:

1. private 
2. halo catalogues and merger trees 
3. particle data 

We are excited to announce that the halo catalogues and merger trees are now available through either direct download or our SQL server. Please see [docs.caterpillar.org](http://docs.caterpillarproject.org) for additional information. 

We request you please be patient with us as we improve any bugs or issues in the documentation during this Phase II release. To assist new users with support for their projects, we have made [available our Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/caterpillarproject/shared_invite/enQtNDE2MjczNjcxODU5LWFmZmRjN2E1MjA0M2JjMzAzMTc0Y2JlMGZmY2IyMWE2OTM5YmNkNGQ4MzRlNWJlYjE4MzdjYmQ3ZjExYTY0OTI).
