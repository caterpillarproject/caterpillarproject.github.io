## Overview 

This site provides documentation, toolkits, and other notes for the Caterpillar project. There's a lot of information about how to do a variety of things here, and it's not all unique to the Caterpillar project. But by and large, understanding how to access the Caterpillar data properly will both speed up your workflow and make assisting you much easier should a problem arise.

## What You Can Find Here

Some of the more prominent features of this wiki include, but are not limited to, the following:

* general information about the simulation suite and parameters
* introduction into the data structure and architecture
* hundreds of little functions and tools to access the data
* examples of how to manipulate, particle data, halo and merger tree catalogues
* compute cluster information for running analysis on either your machine or ours
* documentation about postprocessed datasets such as semi-analytic models
* important information about strengths and limitations of the dataset which are not fully published
* rules of thumb to keep in mind (resolution limits, contamination etc.)

## PDF Download Of Documentation

If you would like to download this wiki as a PDF, you can do so here. The PDF is mostly the same  as the online help, except that some elements (such as video or special layouts) don't translate the the print medium, so they're excluded.

<a target="_blank" class="noCrossRef" href="doc_{{site.audience}}_pdf.pdf"><button type="button" class="btn btn-default" aria-label="Left Align"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-download-alt" aria-hidden="true"></span> PDF Download</button></a>

The PDF contains a timestamp in the header indicating when it was last generated. If you download a PDF, keep in mind that it may go out of date quickly. Always compare your PDF timestamp against the online help timestamp (which you can find in the footer).
