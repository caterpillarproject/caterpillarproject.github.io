                                This depends on the availability of computing time and the limitations of hardware. At the moment we are running many simulations at the same time. This only occurs in bursts when we have available time and we personally have time to oversee them. Each simulation takes roughly 300k hours (exluding halo finding ~2 weeks + postprocessing which is ~1-3 days). With all of these time heavy tasks, we still estimate to have the full sample by Spring/Summer of 2016.

                                Since the collaboration is quite small there is a lot of room to grow with new science. That being said, there are a few core projects which the collaboration is working towards (see the on-going projects page). Provided there is no overlap with the core science projects of the collaboration the data is freely available for anyone who would like to use it. Naturally we hope you collaborate with people within the group so you can achieve your goals as soon as possible as many of us have had years creating/analyzing the data.

                                At the moment, we don't have a full plan in place for complete open access to the data so for the moment individuals are being given access an analysis node at MIT (bigbang). Through this portal, the entire suite is available. The size of the data (300TB+ and growing) makes it difficult to find a one size fits all solution to the public release. We are working with Illustris folks at Harvard to see if there are some optimum ways to deal this kind of load.

                                The short answer is yes, eventually. We have already setup and run gas runs of the parent simulation and are in the process of running hydro runs for the zoom-in simulations. There are many more pieces to this next stage of the project and they are still being interally reviwed (i.e. sure hydro, but _which_ flavour?). This wiki will update the status of the hydro runs in due course.

                                The code is freely available to the community though if it is a non-trivial tool, we ask if you keep the developers (Alex, Greg and Brendan) in the loop so you done become unstuck using the code for the wrong reasons. Similarly, we may be able to help you get a given tool tailored for your own purposes so please let us know if you would like any assistance.

                                Yes, Caterpillar is a dark matter only simulation. Though, that being said quite a lot can be learned from this simulation suite alone. Our main goal however is to run sophisticated semi-analytic models over the merger trees to generate mock galaxies (i.e. with stellar masses, cold gas fractions, morphologies etc.). The Munich SAM is currently being run over the Caterpillar halos and will produce a fantastic data set to do all sorts of analysis (e.g. assembly of the stellar halo, chemical tagging, stellar streams).
